Traffic between a client and the Google Calendar servers occurs over HTTP and allows for both authenticated and unauthenticated connections. Before any transactions can occur, this connection needs to be made. Creating a connection to the calendar servers involves two steps: creating an HTTP client and binding a Zend_Gdata_Calendar service instance to that client. Authentication The Google Calendar API allows access to both public and private calendar feeds. Public feeds do not require authentication, but are read-only and offer reduced functionality. Private feeds offers the most complete functionality but requires an authenticated connection to the calendar servers. There are three authentication schemes that are supported by Google Calendar: ClientAuth provides direct username/password authentication to the calendar servers. Since this scheme requires that users provide your application with their password, this authentication is only recommended when other authentication schemes are insufficient. AuthSub allows authentication to the calendar servers via a Google proxy server. This provides the same level of convenience as ClientAuth but without the security risk, making this an ideal choice for web-based applications. MagicCookie allows authentication based on a semi-random URL available from within the Google Calendar interface. This is the simplest authentication scheme to implement, but requires that users manually retrieve their secure URL before they can authenticate, doesn&#39;t provide access to calendar lists, and is limited to read-only access. The Zend_Gdata library provides support for all three authentication schemes. The rest of this chapter will assume that you are familiar the authentication schemes available and how to create an appropriate authenticated connection. For more information, please see section the Authentication section of this manual or the Authentication Overview in the Google Data API Developer&#39;s Guide . Creating A Service Instance In order to interact with Google Calendar, this library provides the Zend_Gdata_Calendar service class. This class provides a common interface to the Google Data and Atom Publishing Protocol models and assists in marshaling requests to and from the calendar servers. Once deciding on an authentication scheme, the next step is to create an instance of Zend_Gdata_Calendar . The class constructor takes an instance of Zend_Http_Client as a single argument. This provides an interface for AuthSub and ClientAuth authentication, as both of these require creation of a special authenticated HTTP client. If no arguments are provided, an unauthenticated instance of Zend_Http_Client will be automatically created. The example below shows how to create a Calendar service class using ClientAuth authentication: A Calendar service using AuthSub can be created in a similar, though slightly more lengthy fashion: Finally, an unauthenticated server can be created for use with either public feeds or MagicCookie authentication: Note that MagicCookie authentication is not supplied with the HTTP connection, but is instead specified along with the desired visibility when submitting queries. See the section on retrieving events below for an example. Retrieving A Calendar List The calendar service supports retrieving a list of calendars for the authenticated user. This is the same list of calendars which are displayed in the Google Calendar UI, except those marked as &quot; hidden &quot; are also available. The calendar list is always private and must be accessed over an authenticated connection. It is not possible to retrieve another user&#39;s calendar list and it cannot be accessed using MagicCookie authentication. Attempting to access a calendar list without holding appropriate credentials will fail and result in a 401 (Authentication Required) status code. Calling getCalendarListFeed() creates a new instance of Zend_Gdata_Calendar_ListFeed containing each available calendar as an instance of Zend_Gdata_Calendar_ListEntry .

Photo is used to specify the photo which is being searched for, and is specified as an id. A new UserQuery can be constructed as followed: For each query, a number of parameters limiting the search can be requested, or specified, with get(Parameter) and set(Parameter), respectively. They are as follows: Projection sets the format of the data returned in the feed, as either &quot;api&quot; or &quot;base&quot;. Normally, &quot;api&quot; is desired. The default is &quot;api&quot;.
